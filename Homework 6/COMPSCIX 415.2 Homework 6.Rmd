## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

file_path<-'/Users/ephan/Desktop/Homework/Homework\ 6/Whickham.csv'
# csv_data <- read_csv(file = file_path)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
 library(mosaicData)
library(tidyverse)
```

1. What variables are in this data set?

```{r}
# outcome survival status after 20 years: a factor with levels Alive Dead

# smoker smoking status at baseline: a factor with levels No Yes

# age age (in years) at the time of the first survey


```

2. How many observations are there and what does each represent?

```{r}
# 1314 observations on women
# Data on age, smoking, and mortality from a one-in-six survey of the electoral roll in Whickham, a mixed urban and rural district near Newcastle upon Tyne, in the UK. The survey was conducted in 1972-1974 to study heart disease and thyroid disease. A follow-up on those in the survey was conducted twenty years later.
```

3. Create a table (use the R code below as a guide) and a visualization of the relationship between smoking status and outcome, ignoring age. What do you see? Does it make sense?

```{r}
Whickham %>% count(smoker , outcome )

Whickham %>% count(smoker , outcome )%>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar( mapping = aes(x = smoker,y = n, fill = outcome),stat = "identity", position = 'fill')+
  xlab('Smoker')
 
```

4. Recode the age variable into an ordered factor with three categories: age <= 44, age > 44 & age <= 64, and age > 64. Now, recreate visualization from above, but facet on your new age factor. What do you see? Does it make sense?

```{r}
x_cat <- case_when(Whickham$age <= 44 ~ '<= 44',
                  Whickham$age > 44 & Whickham$age <= 64 ~ '45-64',
                   Whickham$age> 64 ~ '> 64')


x_cat <- fct_relevel(x_cat, "under 45", "45-64", "65 and older")

Whickham_2 <- Whickham %>% mutate(age_bin = x_cat)

Whickham_2 %>% count(smoker , outcome, age_bin )%>%
  ggplot() + geom_bar( mapping = aes(x = smoker,y = n,fill = outcome),stat = "identity", position = 'fill')+
  facet_grid(~ age_bin) + 
  labs(x = "Smoker", y = "", fill = "Outcome", title = "Outcome by Smoking Status and Age") + theme_bw()

```

```{r}
# Create vector of levels for new variable
age_cat <- case_when(Whickham$age <= 44 ~ "under 45", 
                     Whickham$age > 44 & Whickham$age <= 64 ~ "45-64", 
                     Whickham$age > 64 ~ "65 and older")
# Recode vector as ordered factor
age_cat <- fct_relevel(age_cat, "under 45", "45-64", "65 and older")
# Add vector to dataframe as new variable
Whickham_2 <- Whickham %>% mutate(age_bin = age_cat)

# Visualization of outcome by smoking status and age
Whickham_2 %>% count(smoker, outcome, age_bin) %>%  
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = smoker, y = n, fill = outcome),
                      stat = "identity", position = "fill") + 
  facet_grid(~ age_bin) + 
  labs(x = "Smoker", y = "", fill = "Outcome", title = "Outcome by Smoking Status and Age") + theme_bw()

# Visualization of smoking status by age
Whickham_2 %>% count(smoker, age_bin) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = smoker, y = n), stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~ age_bin) + 
  labs(x = "Smoker", y = "", title = "Incidence of Smoking by Age") + 
  theme_bw()

# Visualization of outcome by age
Whickham_2 %>% count(outcome, age_bin) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = outcome, y = n), stat = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~ age_bin) + 
  labs(x = "Outcome", y = "", title = "Incidence of Outcome by Age") + 
  theme_bw()
```

1. Generate a random sample of size n = 10000 from a gamma(1,2) distribution and plot a histogram or density curve. Use the code below to help you get your sample.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```
```{r}
n <- 10000
gamma_samp <- tibble(x = rgamma(n, shape = 1, scale = 2))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = gamma_samp , aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab('gamma_samp n=1000')
```

2. What is the mean and standard deviation of your sample? They should both be close to 2 because for a gamma distribution:mean = shape x scale variance = shape x scaleˆ2



```{r}
gamma_samp  %>% 
  summarize(mean_samp = mean(x),
                        sd_samp = sd(x))
```

3. Pretend the distribution of our population of data looks like the plot above. Now take a sample of size n = 30 from a Gamma(1,2) distribution, plot the histogram or density curve, and calculate the mean and standard deviation.

```{r}
n <- 30
gamma_samp <- tibble(x = rgamma(n, shape = 1, scale = 2))

ggplot(data = gamma_samp , aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlab('gamma_samp n=30')

gamma_samp  %>% 
  summarize(mean_samp = mean(x),
                        sd_samp = sd(x))
```
4. Take a sample of size n = 30, again from the Gamma(1,2) distribution, calculate the mean, and assign it to a vector named mean_samp. Repeat this 10000 times!!!! The code below might help.

```{r}

mean_samp <- rep(NA, 10000)

for(i in 1:10000) {
  g_samp <- rgamma(30, shape = 1, scale = 2)
  mean_samp[i] <- mean(g_samp)
}

mean_samp <- tibble(mean_samp)

```

5. Make a histogram of your collection of means from above (mean_samp).

```{r}
ggplot(mean_samp, aes(x=mean_samp)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .05)
```

6. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of all of your sample means.

```{r}
mean_samp %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(mean_samp), sd = sd(mean_samp))


```

7. Did anything surprise you about your answers to #6?

```{r}
#The Standard deivation for #6 was very different form the above's 2 value. The means of the samples are measures of center of the samples, so there is less variation in then the samples, so the standard deviation of the means is less than the standard deviation of a sample.
```

8. According to the Central Limit Theorem, the mean of your sampling distribution should be very close
to 2, and the standard deviation of your sampling distribution should be close to σ = 2 = 0.365. n 30
Repeat #4-#6, but now with a sample of size n = 300 instead. Do your results match up well with the theorem?

```{r}
#yes, The mean and standard deviation match up with the Central Limit Theorem, which predicts that the mean should be close to 2 and the standard deviation should be about 0.365.
mean_samp1 <- rep(NA, 300)
for(i in 1:300) {
  g_samp <- rgamma(30, shape = 1, scale = 2)
  mean_samp1[i] <- mean(g_samp)
}
mean_samp1 <- tibble(mean_samp1)
ggplot(mean_samp1, aes(x=mean_samp1)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = .05)  

mean_samp1 %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(mean_samp1), sd = sd(mean_samp1))

```
