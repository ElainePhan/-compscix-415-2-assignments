## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(mdsr)
library(tidyverse)

#How many rows are in mpg?  5
#How many columns? 12
#What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
#drv value, which describes a car’s drivetrain. 
#Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
#What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
# there are only 3 drv so the graph is not useful
```
Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.

What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
#3.3.1 answers
#1. There is an extra ")" after blue 

#the answer should be 
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

#the color doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot. To set an aesthetic manually, set the aesthetic by name as an argument of your geom function; i.e. it goes outside of aes()

#2 A. Which variables in mpg are categorical? B. Which variables are continuous?
#Categorical variables take on values that are names or labels. Such as car model name, color, trans, class
#Continous variables take on any value between its minimum value and its maximum value. Such as highway miles per gallon, city miles per gallon, cyl.
#C. How can you see this information when you run mpg?
# You can look at the legends and read the labels on the graph or in the Format when running mpg?

# 3. Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes( x = hwy, y = cty, size = cyl, shape = class ), color = "blue")
# you can not put continous variables in shapes. The color we can run both variables. The size and shape can only handle 6 discrete variable.

#4. What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
#The plot only shows one of the variable's aesthetics. 

#5.What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)
#The stroke colour and fill in shapes at differnt fill in amounts. The size of the filled part is controlled by size, the size of the stroke is controlled by stroke. works with circles.


```
`
``
```{r}
# 6. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ < 5)?
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = displ < 5, x = hwy, y = cty, size = cyl, shape = class ), color = "blue")
#It seems to ingnor the it.
```

```{r}

#3.5
#4.
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
#What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? 
# The faceting allows you to look at each data parameter individully and visual likes each par
#What are the disadvantages? The data set can not be over layed on top of each other which allowes more percise comparason. It is harder to correlate the data set together and compare thier relationship to one another especially in large data sets.
#How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset? 
# If you have a large data set it would be very hard to use facet because there would be to many graphs to look at and it would be to difficult to view multiple graphs and compare 50 or data sets to find correlation. It is also easy to get data and graphs confused.  
```

```{r}
#3.5
#5. Read ?facet_wrap. 
#A. What does nrow do?
#Shows number of rows.
#B. What does ncol do?
#Show number of Columns
#C. What other options control the layout of the individual panels? 
# Scale, Shhrink, Labeller, as.table, switch, drop, dir, strip.position
#Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol argument?
#Because the Grid give shows rows and columns in the grid formate
```

```{r}
#3.6.1
#1.
#A. What geom would you use to draw a line chart?
# line charts use line geoms
#B. A boxplot? boxplots use boxplot geoms
#C. A histogram? Histogram plots use Histogram geoms
#D. An area chart? area chart use area chart geoms

#2. 
#Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. 
# a graph with points showing displ on X-axis, hwy on y axis, 
#the drv is in different colors and there are points showing the different drv
# geom_smooth separtes the cars into three lines based on their drv the smooth lines showing the trend.
#Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
   
```

```{r}
#3.6.1
#3 
#A. What does show.legend = FALSE do? The legend shows what the colors or points represent on the graph
#B. What happens if you remove it? If you remove it we can not tell what the different point on the graph represent.
#C. Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter? So we can distringuish the different parameters and points on the graph to intrepret the data.

#4.
#What does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?
#It helps with the lines of the graph be smooth.

#5. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not? 
# No, they look identical. They use different syntax but they produce the same graph.
# the first one puts the descriptions of the plot first after the ggplot and the second syntax adds 
# the descrition after each geom point and geomsmooth.
